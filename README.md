# Reviewing Redux

Just reviewing how to implement a simple redux store using the characters
from F-R-I-E-N-D-S :)

## Store

Empty household with Â£2000 found under the sofa (and Yes they live in
London now!).

* Roommates can join and leave the household
* When they join they contribute with a lump sum of money
* Whe they earn the contribute too
* But someone likes to spend too much
* Someone get frustrated and leaves the apartment
* Surprisingly someone becomes a YouTube Success
